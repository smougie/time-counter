# Time Counter
I came up with idea to create a time counter that will be able to to calculate and visualize time that I need to devote to learning.
By assumption, I'm creating this program to help in separating time for specific task on given day.
I used Tkinter package to create basic GUI.

### Main assumptions of project:
```
1.) I want to divide time for study into three sessions. 
2.) Each of them will last 2 hours and 40 minutes. 
3.) There will be a twenty-minute brake between each session.
4.) Need some pop-up message when the sessions ends.
```
